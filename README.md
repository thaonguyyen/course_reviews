In this homework, we created both a UI and GUI that simulated a course review app. The UI is in the CommandLineUI.java class while the GUI is run through the Main class. 
The user will choose between logging in to an existing account or creating a new account. Once logged in, the user will select an option from the main menu of either seeing reviews for a class or submitting a review from a class.
They cannot submit more than one review for a class and must submit a rating between 1-5. Once a course has more than one review, the user can look at all the reviews for that class and the average rating out of 5. 
Once done, they can log out to be brought back to the log in menu. Both a command line UI and an app set up as a GUI was implemented so the user can choose between both.
